Oh, im also a big Doom fan, i like fast-paced brutal shooters and movement shooters in general, gaming stuff you know? 
Besides gaiming, i love reading too, my favorite book series is Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but i like to read anything action and sci-fi related.

Thats about it for now! Still doing some tweaks on the profile and on the README stuff, learing new things and all that...im gonna revamp this file soon.
